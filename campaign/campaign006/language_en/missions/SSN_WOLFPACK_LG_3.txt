[MISSION WIN]
Fine work eliminating this threat, Commander! Your contribution to the war effort will make transit for our convoys a lot safer - and supporting the troops on land is what the Navy is about! Keep it up, Commander!
[MISSION FAIL]
Commander, inability to meet the enemy submarine threat with resolve will make life on the Atlantic a lot more difficult for our colleagues. Not to mention a heck of a lot more dangerous for the merchies. We'll have to step it up.
[MISSION MISSED]
Sorry for the wild goose chase Commander. It looks like the intelligence boys got this one wrong.
