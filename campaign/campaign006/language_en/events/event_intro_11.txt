Color=57,61,73,255
Sentence1=In recent weeks acting General Secretary Vladimir Kryuchkov has pushed the Soviet military into "an extensive two-month training program, to assure Soviet forces can defend themselves and other Warsaw Pact nations from further aggression." The Red Army has begun to deploy troops to East Germany, the Soviet Air Force is conducting training exercises with Iraqi and Polish aircraft, while the Soviet Navy is making mock attacks on its carriers. With this in mind, the US Chief of Staff Committee has said, "We understand this is a trying time in the Soviet Union, and the death of General Secretary Yanayev was unprecedented and of grave concern. But both sides must now acknowledge that tensions are at a breaking point, and if they do not ease them, the situation may become untenable".

Sentence2=Recent Soviet troop movements to East Germany have also prompted the USS Constellation (CV-64) and several US submarines, including the <PLAYERVESSELNAME>, to be deployed to the Norwegian Sea. NATO has increased readiness levels across the board, and the US has placed its forces on DEFCON 3, the highest it has been since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Recent Soviet troop movements to East Germany have also prompted the US to deploy two Rapid Deployment Forces to Europe to provide additional defense if the situation does take a turn for the worse. NATO has also put REFORGER plans into motion to help supply troops in Europe.
