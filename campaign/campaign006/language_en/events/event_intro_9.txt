Title=<b>NATO Launches Exercise Swift Swordsman ‘03</b>
Color=57,61,73,255
Sentence1=Earlier today, NATO kicked off Swift Swordsman ‘03 to simulate a Soviet invasion of Norway and West Germany. According to reports, the exercise has been planned since mid-2001. A Royal Marine battalion simulates a Soviet amphibious assault on the Norwegian port of Narvik and the SOSUS station at Andoya, located just north of the port. At the same time, a US carrier battle group is on station to provide air cover to a Norwegian Marine counter-attack while simultaneously defending itself from air and submarine threats.

Sentence2=Exercise Reforger operations are also underway, with NATO submarines simulating attacks on the convoys with the surface ships defending them. A special NATO analysis team will look over the results of these engagements to help improve defense plans against a possible Soviet invasion. Air and land activity has created several noise disturbances throughout West Germany and Norway, prompting small protests; these incidents and recent reductions in European defense budgets have brought up the big question, does the European public support the continuation of the Cold War?
