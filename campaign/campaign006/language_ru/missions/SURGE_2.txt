[MISSION WIN]
Excellent job on intercepting and destroying Soviet submarine assets.  You and your crew have given the Reds a bloody nose right off the bat.  
[MISSION FAIL]
Discouraged to hear you lost this opportunity to significantly weaken Soviet forces. Better luck next time.
[MISSION MISSED]
Disappointed to hear your results were not better. Be more aggressive.
