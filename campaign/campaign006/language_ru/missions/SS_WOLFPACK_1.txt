[MISSION WIN]
Fine work dealing with those boats, Commander! Every sub we kill makes it that much safer for our Navy and merchant colleagues.  
[MISSION FAIL]
Commander, inability to meet the enemy submarine threat with resolve will make life on the Atlantic a lot more difficult for our colleagues, not to mention a heck of a lot more dangerous for the merchies. We'll have to step it up.
[MISSION MISSED]
Discouraged to hear that the mission could not be carried through. Every red sub that makes it into the Atlantic means the thinning out of our resources and weakening our sea lane defenses. Try harder next time.
