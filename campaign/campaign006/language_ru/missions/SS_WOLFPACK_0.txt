[MISSION WIN]
Fine work dealing with those Kilos, Commander! Your contribution to the war effort will make life for our boys a lot safer! Keep it up, Commander!
[MISSION FAIL]
Commander, inability to meet the enemy submarine threat with resolve will make life on the Atlantic a lot more difficult for our colleagues. Not to mention a heck of a lot more dangerous for the merchies. We'll have to step it up.
[MISSION MISSED]
Discouraged to hear that the mission could not be carried through. Remember that time works for the enemy, not for us. Try harder next time.
