Sentence2=Concerns have been raised regarding Soviet treatment of war prisoners. Disturbing reports suggest that significant numbers of officers and enlisted men have been subjected to torture, tried as war criminals or executed. Countless more have allegedly been interned at numerous Gulag labor camps throughout the Soviet Union. The fate of thousands of unaccounted NATO troops and non-combatants will likely not be confirmed until hostilities cease.
