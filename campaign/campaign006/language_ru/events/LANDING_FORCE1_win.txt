Sentence2=According to analysts, the ability of NATO to contain the enemy and prevent the opening of new fronts will be a major factor in the outcome of the war. Keeping the frontline focused, rather than spread out across multiple territories, will hopefully ensure success.|Some commentators pointed to the victory as a potential turning point in the war.  Others offered a more sober view.  "Had NATO not stopped this invasion, it would have been a catastrophe," said one CNN analyst. "But the rest of Western Europe is still a battleground, and the outcome is far from sure."
