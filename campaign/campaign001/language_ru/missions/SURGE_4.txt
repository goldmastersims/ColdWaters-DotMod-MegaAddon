[MISSION WIN]
Excellent job on intercepting and destroying advanced Soviet subs.  This is going to be a long war, but you and your crew have hopefully helped to shorten it. 
[MISSION FAIL]
Discouraged to hear you lost this opportunity to significantly attrite soviet forces. We can't take too many more mistakes like this.
[MISSION MISSED]
Disappointed to hear your results were not better. You must be more aggressive if we have any chance of winning this conflict.
