[MISSION WIN]
COMSUBLANT was very happy to hear about your recent success, Commander. The excellent work of you and your crew will be rewarded upon your next port visit! Well done.
[MISSION FAIL]
Commander, inability to meet the enemy submarine threat with resolve will make life on the Atlantic a lot more difficult for our colleagues. Not to mention a heck of a lot more dangerous for the merchies. We'll have to step it up.
[MISSION MISSED]
Further search for the enemy deemed unproductive at this time.
