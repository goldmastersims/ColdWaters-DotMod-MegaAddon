[MISSION WIN]
Excellent job, Commander! Believe me, no one wanted to send a nuke boat into those shallow waters, but we had no other options.  You and your crew performed superbly under very difficult circumstances.  
[MISSION FAIL]
Commander, inability to meet the enemy submarine threat with determination will lengthen this war and put a lot of our colleagues in danger.  
[MISSION MISSED]
Discouraged to hear that the mission could not be carried out. Remember, every Red sub that gets through is a big threat to our war effort. Try harder next time.
