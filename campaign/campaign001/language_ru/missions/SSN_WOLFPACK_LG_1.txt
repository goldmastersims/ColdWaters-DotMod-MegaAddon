[MISSION WIN]
Very pleased to see that you dealt with those subs with determination and resolve, Commander! This was a desperate gamble on the Russians' part, and thanks to you it did not pay off.  Good work.  
[MISSION FAIL]
Commander, inability to meet this new submarine threat is going to make life on the Atlantic a lot more difficult for our sailors. I expect better.
[MISSION MISSED]
Discouraged to hear you failed to intercept the enemy. Expect better hunting from you next time.
