[MISSION WIN]
Outstanding job eliminating the threat from that wolfpack! Your contributions will help to shorten this war and keep our people safe.  
[MISSION FAIL]
Commander, inability to meet the enemy submarine threat with resolve will make life on the Atlantic a lot more difficult for our merchant colleagues. 
[MISSION MISSED]
Discouraged to hear that the mission could not be completed. Every Soviet sub that makes it into the Atlantic means one more convoy is potentially in jeopardy.  You must try harder next time.
