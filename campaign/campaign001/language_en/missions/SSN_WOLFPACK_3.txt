[MISSION WIN]
Fine work dealing with a VERY difficult target set, Commander! Your contribution to the war effort has not gone unnoticed! Keep it up!
[MISSION FAIL]
Commander, inability to meet the enemy submarine threat with resolve will make life on the Atlantic a lot more difficult for our colleagues. Not to mention a heck of a lot more dangerous for the merchies. We'll have to step it up.
[MISSION MISSED]
Discouraged to hear that the mission could not be completed.  If those subs make it to the Atlantic there will be hell to pay.
