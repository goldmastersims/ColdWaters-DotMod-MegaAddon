Congratulations on a job extremely well done! Sinking those subs keeps our boys safe and sends an unmistakable message to the Russians.  
[MISSION FAIL]
Disappointing outcome. Expect better hunting next time.
[MISSION MISSED]
Further search deemed unproductive.  Hopefully other assets will be more successful.
