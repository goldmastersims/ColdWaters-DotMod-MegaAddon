[MISSION WIN]
Fine work dealing with those enemy subs, Commander! Your contribution to the war effort will make transit for our convoys a lot safer.  We are winning this war thanks to subs like <PLAYERVESSELNAME>!  
[MISSION FAIL]
Commander, inability to meet the enemy submarine threat with resolve will make life on the Atlantic a lot more difficult for our colleagues. Not to mention a heck of a lot more dangerous for the merchies. Step it up.
[MISSION MISSED]
Discouraged to hear that the mission could not be carried through. Remember that time works for the enemy, not for us. Every red ship that makes it into the Atlantic means the thinning out of our resources and weakening our sea lane defenses. Try harder next time.
