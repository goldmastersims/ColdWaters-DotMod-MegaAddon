[MISSION WIN]
Very pleased to see that you dealt with that SSGN, Commander! Sinking her nearly within sight of land must have been a huge blow to the Reds' morale.  Well done.
[MISSION FAIL]
Commander, your inability to meet the enemy submarine threat with resolve is disappointing.  
[MISSION MISSED]
Discouraged to hear you failed to intercept the enemy. Expect better hunting from you next time.
