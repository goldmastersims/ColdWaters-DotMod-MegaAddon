History=The Sovremenny is a companion class to the Udaloys, but where the latter are optimized for ASW operations, the Sovremennys are optimized for the anti-ship mission. The design is clearly derived from the earlier Kresta design, with almost identical dimensions and likely the same steam plant. Instead of the large SA-N-3 area defense system, they are fitted with a medium-range SAM system and more extensive command and control spaces but carry only rudimentary ASW weapons. In the 1990's and 2000's, they recieved numerous electronics upgrades that allows them to fire the most modern Soviet weaponry. In a break with Soviet praxis, they feature an amidships landing pad, similar to western designs.
