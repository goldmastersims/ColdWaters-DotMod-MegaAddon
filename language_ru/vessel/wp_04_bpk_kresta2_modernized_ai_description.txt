Description=Kresta II-class Large Anti-Submarine Ship (Modernized)

History=This class of guided-missile cruisers is a modification of the Kresta I-class rocket cruisers, redesigned to specialize in ASW, though they still retain an effective area-defense anti-air capability as well. In the 1990's and 2000's, they recieved numerous electronics upgrades that allows them to fire the most modern Soviet weaponry. While they lack VDS equipment, their ability to use the shipboard KA-27 helicopter as target designator for their battery of SS-N-14 missiles make them dangerous opponents.
