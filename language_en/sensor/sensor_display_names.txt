//----------------------------------------Submarine-------------------------------
wp_mars="Mars-24KIG"=Passive high-frequency set that dates back to WWII. This set was improved over the years, but is hopelessly outdated by now. The Whiskey-class was originally equipped with this set before receiving Trout Cheek during modernization.
wp_tamir="Tamir-5L"=NATO reporting name: "Perch Gill". This is a very old high-frequency, active-only set that equiped the Whiskey-class diesel subs before their modernization.
wp_plutoniy="Plutoniy"=NATO reporting name: "Stag Ear". Submarine variant of the active-only "Tamir-11" set. Was installed in Whiskey-class diesel subs as a part of their upgrades.
wp_mg-200=MG-200 "Arktika"=NATO reporting name: "Pike Jaw". This high frequency set is common among the late 1950's generation where it equips the Foxtrot and November class boats, generally in conjunction with Trout Cheek. It can therefore be assumed that Pike Jaw is likewise a derivative of German wartime designs.="Arktika"
wp_mg-10=MG-10 "Feniks"=NATO reporting name: "Trout Cheek". This system was derived from the German wartime Balkongerat sonar fitted in the Type XXI. It is comparable to the BQR-2/BQS-4 suite fitted to the Skipjack.="Feniks"
wp_mgk-100=MGK-100 "Kerch"=NATO reporting name: Active - "Shark Fin", Passive - "Shark Teeth" Active: This medium frequency set equips some Soviet boats of the late 1960's, where it forms the active component of the Shark Teeth passive suite. Passive: This cylindrical low frequency array is fitted on the Victor, Juliet, Tango and Charlie class submarines. It is comparable in performance to the US BQQ-2 and doubles the detection range compared to the earlier Trout Cheek MF array.="Kerch"
wp_mgk-300=MGK-300 "Rubin"=NATO reporting name: "Shark Sail".="Rubin"
wp_mgk-1000=MGK-1000 "Okean"=NATO reporting name: "Squid Arm". This is an advanced low frequency sonar array unique to the Alfa-class fast attack submarine where it feeds a highly automated command-and-control system, the details of which little is known.="Okean"
wp_mgk-400=MGK-400 "Rubikon"=NATO reporting name: "Shark Gill". Part of a new generation of Soviet sonar systems, this cylindrical low frequency array is used on submarines where it equips the Victor III, Charlie II, Delta III and IV, Typhoon and Oscar classes. Compared to the earlier Shark Teeth, this set is better than the BQQ-2 of the early Permit- and Sturgeon classes, and almost comparable to the BBQ-5 that equips the latest US subs.\n \nIt is rumoured that an advanced version of this suite equips the Sierra-class submarine, but little is known at this time.="Rubikon"
wp_mgk-500=MGK-500 "Skat"=NATO reporting name: "Shark Gill".="Skat"
wp_mgk-540=MGK-540 "Skat-3"=NATO reporting name: "Shark Gill".="Skat-3"
wp_mgk-600=MGK-600 "Amphora"=Little is known about this integrated spherical sonar suite that equips russian next-generation boats such as the Yasen-class.="Amphora"

//----------------------------------------Ship-------------------------------
wp_bull_horn=Bull Horn=This hull-mounted active/passive medium frequency set is mounted on later Soviet ships where it replaces the earlier Bull Nose medium frequency array.
wp_bull_nose=Bull Nose=This is a medium-frequency passive/active array dating from the late 1960's. Though incapable of detecting US subs at anything above medium ranges, this design was clearly regarded as a success by the Soviets who equipped it on almost every major class of anti-submarine ship during the 1970's.
wp_wolf_paw=Wolf Paw=This is an older medium frequency sonar set that equipped many surface ships before the introduction of Bull Nose.
wp_buck_toe=Buck Toe=Definitely antiquated by 1980's standards, this is a searchlight-style high frequency active array, little better than WW2 active sonars.
wp_moose_jaw=Moose Jaw=This is a very large low-frequency array first observed on the Moskva's, but which also equips the Kiev class.

wp_mgk-355=MGK-355 "Polinom"=This is a follow-on to the Moose Jaw that equips the Kirov and Udaloy classes, and gives these ships tremendous capability against even silent US submarines.="Polinom"

//   1b) Towed
//----------------------------------------Submarine-------------------------------
wp_mgk-500_ta=TA "Skat"=NATO reporting name: "Shark Tail". This is a passive low-frequency towed array that equips all Soviet submarines of recent construction from the Victor III onwards. While not comparable to American towed array systems, it nevertheless provides the Soviets wih an improved sonar capability which earlier generations were lacking, giving these newer boats something of a quantum leap in capabilities and the threat they provide.
wp_pelamida="Pelamida"=NATO reporting name: "Shark Tail". This passive low-frequency towed array is a part of MGK-540 "Skat-3" suite that equips Akula class submarines.
wp_amfora_ta=Little is known about this towed array that equips russian next-generation boats such as the Yasen-class.

//----------------------------------------Ship-------------------------------
wp_foal_tail=Foal Tail=This high frequency variable depth sonar (VDS) is a shipboard derivative of the dipping sonar mounted on the Ka-25 Hormone A anti-submarine helicopters. Commonly mounted on smaller patrol ships, the ability to search beneath the layer makes it a dangerous system to encounter in shallow waters.
wp_mare_tail=Mare Tail=This large variable depth sonar (VDS) was first observed on the Moskva-class helicopter cruisers, and later on the Kiev, Kara and Krivak classes where it provides these ships the ability to scan beneath the thermal layer when applying sprint-and-drift tactics.
wp_horse_tail=Horse Tail=Larger and much more capable than Mare Tail, Horse Tail is a towed low frequency variable depth sonar (VDS) which equips the Kirov and Udaloy classes where it gives these ships the ability to search beneath the layer for considerable distances.

usn_an_bqq_6=AN/BQQ-6=This is a hull-mounted, sonar suite adopted from the AN/BQQ-5 suite for use on board of Ohio class SSBN. Passive sonar system has 944 hydrophone transducers mounted on a sphere and 100 transducers i two flank arrays. AN/BQS-13 system is an active component of this suite. It has lower capabilities compared to one in AN/BQQ-5 suite.
usn_bqq_10=AN/BQQ-10=The AN/BQQ-10 advanced sonar suite uses a spherical array with the latest digital signal processing techniques using commercial off the shelf components to provide improved performance over the older AN/BQQ-5 system, and allow faster upgrades.

The sonar is an active/passive, preformed beam, digital sonar providing panoramic echo ranging and panoramic (DIMUS) passive surveillance. A single operator can search, track, classify and designate multiple targets from the active system while simultaneously maintaining anti-torpedo surveillance on the passive display.
