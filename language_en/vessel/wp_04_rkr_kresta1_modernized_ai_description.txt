ShipClassShort=Kresta I (M)
Description=Kresta I-class Guided Missile Cruiser (Modernized)
History=This class was designed as a larger and more capable successor to the Kynda-class missile cruisers, which turned out top-heavy and too cramped. The Kresta I is intended for the anti-ship role but has much improved capabilities for anti-air and anti-submarine warfare. These ships are among the oldest in the Soviet fleet, and are on their way out, but have recently been used in several flag-showing and diplomatic cruises.
