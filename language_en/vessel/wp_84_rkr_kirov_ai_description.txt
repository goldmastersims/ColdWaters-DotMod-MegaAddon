History=The Kirov is the ultimate embodiment of the Soviet rocket cruiser concept. With dimensions much like those of a World War II battleship, these are among the most powerful surface combatants ever built, with two of these ships built since 1980, with a further two under construction. Their large size is made necessary by the need to accommodate a large battery of anti-ship missiles as well as an area-defence surface-to-air missile system with several close-in defenses as backup.\n\nThough fitted with advanced sonar and stand-off ASW weapons, these ships generally operate as flagships of surface warfare groups protected by dedicated ASW ships.
