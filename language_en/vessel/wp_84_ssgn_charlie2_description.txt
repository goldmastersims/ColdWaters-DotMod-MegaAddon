[Unit Reference]
ShipClass=Charlie2
Description=Charlie II-class Nuclear Cruise Missile Submarine
History=The Charlie II's differ from the Charlie 1 primarily in adopting the SS-N-9 Siren missile in place of the short-legged SS-N-7 Starbright, which necessitated lengthening the sub. They are also fitted with a somewhat quieter tandem propeller and have the ability to fire SS-N-15 stand-off missiles from their torpedo tubes, making them more formidable opponents.
