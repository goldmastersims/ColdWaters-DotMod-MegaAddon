ShipClass=Charlie II (Mod)
ShipClassShort=Charlie II (M)
Description=Charlie II-class Nuclear Cruise Missile Submarine (Modernized)
History=The Charlie II's differ from the Charlie 1 primarily in adopting the SS-N-9 Siren missile in place of the short-legged SS-N-7 Starbright, which necessitated lengthening the sub. They are also fitted with a somewhat quieter tandem propeller and have the ability to fire SS-N-15 stand-off missiles from their torpedo tubes, making them more formidable opponents. In the 1990's and 2000's, they recieved numerous electronics upgrades that allows them to fire the most modern Soviet weaponry.
