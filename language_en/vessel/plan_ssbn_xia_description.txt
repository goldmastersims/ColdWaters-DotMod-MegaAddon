ShipClass=Xia
Description=Xia-class Nuclear Ballistic Missile Submarine
History=Laid down in 1978 and completed in 1981, the Xia is a one-of-a-kind first generation Chinese SSBN. It is basically an enlarged Han-class submarine with a missile compartment added, and so the sensor suite and propulsion plant is probably the same, making it a rather noisy submarine, comparable to early US and Soviet boomers.
