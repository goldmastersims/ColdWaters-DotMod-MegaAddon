Description=Jianghu 3-class Frigate
History=This class is a development of the earlier Jianghu, but patterned more obviously on contemporary European designs, with airtight cabins, central air conditioning, NBC protection and integrated combat systems using solid-state electronics. The design features four box launchers for the YJ-8 anti ship missile, along with an improved bow sonar that allows the ship to engage submarines using an improved ASW mortar battery.
