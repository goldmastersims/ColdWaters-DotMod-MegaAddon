Description=Algol class Fast Sealift Ship
History=The Algol-class vehicle cargo ships, also known as Fast Sealift Ships (FSS) or SL-7s, are the fastest cargo ships in the world, capable of speeds in excess of 33 knots. Originally built in 1972 and 1973 as high-speed container ships known as SL-7's for Sea-Land Services, Inc., the ships' high operating costs limited their profitability. All eight ships were acquired by the US Navy in 1981 and 1982. The conversion entailed the installation of four cranes, addition of roll on/roll off capability and a redesign of the cargo hold to better facilitate storage of vehicles. Due largely to their high cost of operation, in time of peace all fast sealift ships are kept in Reduced Operating Status, but can be activated and ready to sail in 96 hours. All ships are named after bright stars in the night sky.
