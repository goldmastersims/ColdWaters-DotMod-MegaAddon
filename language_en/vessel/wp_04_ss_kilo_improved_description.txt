Description=Kilo-class Diesel-Electric Submarine (Improved)
History=During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Sovier design bureaus began looking for ways to improve the already mass-produced Kilo design. Improvements to speed, firecontrol, and quieting where all made tot he design touted as the "Improved Kilo" or "Kilo II". Very quickly these ships gained a large number of export sales, which would help boost the Soviet economy and defense budget, and it wasn't long before the Sovier Navy ordered several of these vessels for themselves. By 2004, about a quarter of the Soviet diesel-electric submarine force is made up of Improved Kilos. These vessels are incredibly quiet and stealthy, making them perfect to ambush NATO submarines operating in shallow water.
