ShipClass=Charlie1
Description=Charlie I-class Nuclear Cruise Missile Submarine

History=The Charlie was the world's first cruise-missile submarine capable of submerged launch, making these boats much more of a threat than the earlier Echo and Juliets which had to surface to launch their missiles. Unlike the earlier generation, these boats featured improved quieting, advanced sonars and improved automation making them similar in capability to the Victor 1 class. The use of a single reactor makes them much slower, however, which remains their primary drawback.
