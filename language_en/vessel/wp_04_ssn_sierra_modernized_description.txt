Description=Sierra-class Nuclear Attack Submarine (Modernized)

History=This is the latest and most advanced Soviet attack submarine. They are faster and deeper diving than US submarines, and feature the same sensors and weapons as the Victor IIIs in a much quieter hull. They benefit greatly from weapons and electronics modernizations in the 1990s, making them some of the most dangerous sub-surface opponets for even the most advanced NATO subs.
