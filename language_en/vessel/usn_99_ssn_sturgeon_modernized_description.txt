[Unit Reference]
ShipClass=Sturgeon (Mod)
ShipClassShort=Sturgeon (M)
Description=Sturgeon-class Nuclear Attack Submarine (Modernized)
History=In service since 1967, this class formed the backbone of US attack submarines during the Cold War until the mid-80's. Despite being nearly 40 years old, these boats have been retained to help keep the growing Soviet fleet in check, and can still give Soviet wolfpacks headaches, but doing sorequires a much more defensive approach. Their only drawback is their comparatively low speed.
