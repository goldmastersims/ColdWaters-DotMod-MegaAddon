Description=Victor I-class Nuclear Attack Submarine

History=This class of sixteen boats was completed in 1968 through 1975. They are not as quiet or as capable as contemporary US boats, but they were a major improvement on the earlier November class boats. They are designed for high speed with little effort at silencing, but are fitted with electric creep motors for silent drive.
