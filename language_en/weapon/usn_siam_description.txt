WeaponName=SIAM
WeaponDescriptiveName=UIM-74 Spear SAM
WeaponDescription=The UIM-74 started as a DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Project Agency) program in the 1970's to develop a submarine-launched SAM that could be launched while completely submerged. The missile dubbed the SIAM (Self Initiating Anit-Aircaft Missile), was only 100" long, began land-based testing in the mid-1980's against QH-50 DASH helicopter drones, which they performed succesfully. The project was finally handed over to the USN in the late 1980's where it eventually lost funding and was shelved.
